# Google-Keep-Clone
A React-based Google Keep Clone built with Material-UI

## Overview

This project is a clone of Google Keep, a note-taking application, implemented using React and Material-UI. The application offers a clean and intuitive user interface for creating, editing, and organizing notes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

- **Material-UI Integration**: Leveraging the power of Material-UI components, the project maintains a modern and aesthetic design.

- **React Router**: Utilizing React Router for client-side navigation, providing a smooth and dynamic user experience without full page reloads.

- **State Management**: Different state management techniques are employed, including local component state, lifting state up, and Context API for efficient and organized state handling.

- **Context Hooks**: Context hooks are used to manage and share state between components, reducing prop drilling and enhancing code maintainability.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Google-Keep-Clone.git
   cd Google-Keep-Clone


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
